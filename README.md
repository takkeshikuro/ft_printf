# ft_printf_42
ft_printf project for 42paris

This is just a quick reinterpretation of the function "printf" from the stdio library. \
the function must be integrated as : 
`int printf(const char *format, ...);`

this reproduction only takes into account few conversions :\
`%d` = for decimal integer\
`%i` = for specifies integer.\
`%s` = for string\
`%x` = for hexadecimal\
`%X` = for hexadecimal MAJ \
`%p` = for memory adress\
`%u` = for unsigned int
